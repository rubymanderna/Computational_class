    "Much of the power of programming languages lies in the ability to perform complicated operators on data.  Data used throughout a program is stored in variables.  We can use *most* any name we want for variables, though there are some best practices:  we should try to use descriptive names when possible, we should use lower case letters, we should separate words in compound names with an underscore.  We **cannot** use certain words that correspond to built-in functions in python, like `print`, `for`, `while`, `if`, `elif`, `else`, `type` to name a few commmon ones.\n",

    "We can also store many types of data as variables.  Data types in python include `int` (integers), `floats` (numbers with decimal places), `str` (strings of characters, e.g. words), `complex` (complex numbers), `bool` (boolean True/False)."

    "**An important property of Hermitian matrices is that their eigevalues are real numbers**.  In quantum mechanics, we associate the possible outcomes of measurements with the eigenvalues of Hermitian operators corresponding to the observable being measured.  In this notebook, we have been talking about the observable of spin angular momentum, which is a vector quantity. We have been specifically looking at the operators and eigenstates related to the z-component of spin angular momentum, denoted $S_z$. We have seen that this operator has two eigenstates,\n",

One way of interpreting these equations is to say that the action of a matrix on its eigenvectors is simply to scale the magnitude of the vector by a number (specifically, scale it by its eigenvalue).  This is a very special situation, because typically speaking, when a vector is multiplied by a matrix, the result is a new vector that points along a new direction and has a different magnitude.  For a lovely explanation with graphical illustrations, please consult [this vide](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g).  In fact, the entire 3b1b series on linear algebra is wonderful!\n",
