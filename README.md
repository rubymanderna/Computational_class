Welcome to the Computational Chemistry Course Homework repository! This repository contains Homework files
for a computational chemistry course aimed at students interested in learning 
about theoretical methods and computational tools commonly used in quantum chemistry research.

Homework_1_computational: This file contains the Python basics like like variable creation and assignment, Plotting and Data Visualization using the Jupyter notebook. 

Spin_one half Notebook: This notebook covers more Basics of python and numpy like Import statements,
Basic arithmetic, NumPy Arrays: Vectors, Numpy Arrays: Matrices, Dot products between vectors,
Matrix-vector products, Matrix-matrix products, Hermitian matrices, Eigenvalues and eigenvectors and Commutators.  
 
CO_Perturbation_Theory: In this notebook we are Computing Fundamental Transition of CO under different levels of approximation.
