Welcome to the Computational Chemistry Course Homework repository! This repository contains Homework files
for a computational chemistry course aimed at students interested in learning 
about theoretical methods and computational tools commonly used in quantum chemistry research.

**Homework_1_computational**: This file contains Python basics like variable creation and assignment, Plotting, and Data Visualization using the Jupyter Notebook. 

**Spin_one half Notebook**: This notebook covers more Basics of Python and Numpy like Import statements,
Basic arithmetic, NumPy Arrays: Vectors, Numpy Arrays: Matrices, Dot products between vectors,
Matrix-vector products, Matrix-matrix products, Hermitian matrices, Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and Commutators.  
 
**CO_Perturbation_Theory**: In this notebook, we are Computing the Fundamental Transition Energy of CO with different levels of approximation.
